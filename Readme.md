Forecast for Parkinson's Disease
Based on patient data, this study employs machine learning to forecast the existence of Parkinson's disease. We employ two primary models:

Data Preparation for the Logistic Regression and  XGBoost Project Steps:

The dataset (proj_data.csv) should be loaded and cleaned.
For model training, distinct features and the aim (existence of disease) should be used.
Training Models:

Use the dataset to train the XGBoost and Logistic Regression models.
Analyze model performance using classification reports and accuracy ratings.
Illustrations:

Confusion Matrix: Indicates how accurately each model distinguishes between actual and anticipated cases.
Features that are most crucial for predictions are highlighted by Feature Importance (XGBoost).
